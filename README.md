# dotfiles
Author: Joey Dodson

This repository simply exists to track my own configuration (a.k.a. dotfiles). I have made it public in case anyone finds it interesting or useful. 

This repo is currently tracking the following files:
-.gitconfig
-.inputrc
-.profile
-.tmux.conf
-.vimrc

To use install these files, clone this repo into your home directory and then run the bash script 'makelinks.sh'
